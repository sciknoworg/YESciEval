Scientific synthesis generation involves creating a concise, coherent, and integrated summary from a collection of scientific texts (such as research paper titles and abstracts) that addresses a specific research question. Unlike general text summarization, which may focus on extracting or abstracting key points from a single text or multiple texts on a broad topic, scientific synthesis is more specialized. It requires:

- Understanding and Addressing a Specific Research Question: The synthesis must specifically answer a research question, requiring a deep understanding of the subject matter and the ability to extract and integrate relevant information from various sources.
- Use of Scientific Literature: The process involves synthesizing information from scientific literature, such as research papers, focusing on the given titles and abstracts. This requires not only summarizing these texts but also evaluating their relevance, correctness, and completeness in the context of the research question.
- Synthesis Format: The synthesis output should be concisely presented in a single paragraph of not more than 200 words. This format requires distilling and integrating diverse scientific insights into a coherent and comprehensive summary that addresses the research question directly. The single-paragraph format emphasizes the importance of concise and integrated communication of complex information.
- Synthesize vs. Summarize: The goal is to synthesize—meaning to combine elements to form a coherent whole—rather than just summarize each source individually. This involves integration, cohesion, and coherence of information from multiple sources, presenting it in a way that produces new insights or understanding in response to the research question.
- Referencing Source Material: Each claim or piece of information in the synthesis must be traceable to the source material (the abstracts), ensuring the synthesis's accuracy and reliability.
- Adherence to Quality Characteristics: It should be possible to evaluate the synthesis quality based on correctness characteristic, ensuring it effectively communicates the synthesized information.

In essence, scientific synthesis generation is a complex task that goes beyond simply summarizing texts; it involves critically analyzing, integrating, and presenting scientific information from multiple sources to succinctly answer a targeted research question, adhering to high standards of clarity, reliability, and insightfulness.

<Task-Description>
A user will provide you with a synthesis which has been generated as an answer to a research question using the titles and abstracts of relevant research works.  You will also be provided with the research question and the paper titles+abstracts of the relevant works that were synthesized. You must use the evaluation characteristic listed below to evaluate a given scientific synthesis. The general objective is that a synthesis should succinctly address the research question by synthesizing only the content from the provided abstracts, while also referencing the source abstract for each claim.
</Task-Description>

<Evaluation-Characteristics>
1. Correctness: is the information in the answer a correct representation of the content of the provided abstracts?
</Evaluation-Characteristics>

<Rating-Scale>
For a given characteristic, rate the quality from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Follow the guidelines specified below for each rating per evaluation characteristic.

1. Correctness
Rating 1. Very bad: The synthesis consistently misrepresents or inaccurately portrays the content of the provided abstracts, showing a significant deviation from the original sources.
Rating 2. Bad: The synthesis contains several inaccuracies or misinterpretations of the source abstracts.
Rating 3. Moderate: The synthesis accurately represents most of the content from the provided abstracts but may contain minor errors.
Rating 4. Good: The synthesis provides an accurate representation of the content from the provided abstracts with minor exceptions.
Rating 5. Very good: The information in the synthesis is an accurate and faithful representation of the content from the provided abstracts, without any factual errors or misinterpretations.
</Rating-Scale>

<Response-Format>
For each characteristic rate the quality from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).  Provide a short rationale for each rating.
