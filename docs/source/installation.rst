.. sidebar:: Verify the installation

    Once the isntallation is done, verify the installation by:

        print(yescieval.__version__)


.. tab:: From PyPI

    YESciEval is available on the Python Package Index at `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/YESciEval/>`_ for installation.
    ::

        pip install -U yescieval

.. tab:: From GitHub

    The following pip install will installs the latest version of OntoLearner from the `main` branch of the YESciEval at GitHub using `pip`.

    ::

        pip install git+https://github.com/sciknoworg/YESciEval.git


Install from Source
----------------------
You can install YESciEval directly from source to take advantage of the bleeding edge main branch for development.


1. Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/sciknoworg/YESciEval.git
    cd YESciEval

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies and the library

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

.. hint:: The -e flag installs the package in editable mode, which is ideal for developmentâ€”changes in the code reflect immediately.
