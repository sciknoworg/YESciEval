## 1. How to Contribute?


| Contribution               | How?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Reporting Bugs          | If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior, please report it via [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sciknoworg/YESciEval/issues) with details and  screenshots of the bug report. Also mention what was your expected behavior and also your operating system and python version that you are using.                              |
| 2. Improving Documentation | If you have suggestions to make our documentation clearer or more professional, or if you think additional sections are needed, feel free to let us know. Alternatively, you can make the changes directly and submit a pull request for us to review.                                                                                        |


## 2. Commit Guidelines

For efficient code review, *`make one commit per logical change`* and keep changes small to speed up the process and simplify troubleshooting. Avoid mixing whitespace changes with functional updates, and separate unrelated functional changes into distinct commits. Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add preprocessing step") and keep the subject concise, ideally under 60 characters. Focus on what the change does, not how it‚Äôs done, and format references to issues or PRs like "Add LLaMA-3.2 [#2]". Optionally, use emoji codes for clarity.


**This is an Optional** but feel free to use the following emoji codes in your message.
